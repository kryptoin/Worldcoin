Disclaimer: This project is a community-driven fork of a legacy cryptocurrency originally developed in 2013 and long since discontinued. It has been substantially restructured, modernized, and repurposed as part of a fresh initiative.

The original codebase served as an initial foundation but has undergone deep modification to reflect new functionality, dependencies, and goals. This fork should be regarded as an entirely separate project, with no official affiliation, support, or endorsement from the creators of the original chain.

Any references to the legacy project are for historical context only. This new chain is under active development and may differ significantly from its predecessor in terms of protocol behavior, architecture, and ecosystem philosophy.

Use at your own discretion and always validate the software before deploying it in production environments.
